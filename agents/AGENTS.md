# Blog Agents Documentation

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document provides comprehensive documentation for our custom blog-creation agent team built using the Claude Sub-Agents framework. We've created a sophisticated **master-sub-agent architecture** that provides strategic oversight while leveraging specialized expertise at each phase of the content creation process.

> **Note** The definitive workflow instructions live in `BLOG_WORKFLOW.md` (full playbook) and `WORKFLOW_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (cheat-sheet). Older setup notes have been merged here and removed to prevent drift.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

- **Master Agent**: Maintains strategic oversight, quality standards, and project context
- **Sub-Agents**: Focus on their specific areas of expertise with deep specialization
- **Quality Gates**: Review and approval at each phase ensures consistent quality
