## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Requirements**

### **H2 Generation (Step 2)**
- **20 main H2s** for article content
- **3 intro H2s** (meta-description only)
- **3 conclusion H2s** (meta-description only)
- **NO web browsing** - avoid copycat content

### **Outline Creation (Step 3)**
- Select **5-10 H2s** for main content
- **NEVER include intro/conclusion H2s in final blog**
- Order for complete story flow
- Output: Raw Markdown outline

### **Content Creation (Step 6)**
- Write **main H2 sections first**
- **One H2 + H3s per call** for quality
- Write **intro last** (using intro H2 as meta-description)
- Write **conclusion last** (using conclusion H2 as meta-description)

### **H3 Guidelines**
- **0â€“5 H3s** per H2.
- Include an H3 **only** when it is essential to fully cover the sub-topic; 0 is acceptable for self-contained H2s.
- Fewer is better than fluff; avoid redundant or obvious sub-headings.

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If H2s aren't diverse enough**
- Ask brainstormer to focus on creative angles
- Request more topical authority coverage

### **If outline flow is weak**
- Ask outline writer to focus on story progression
- Request logical ordering from beginning to end

### **If content is too generic**
- Ask content writer to focus on unique insights
- Request more specific examples and details

### **If review finds issues**
- Use iteration loop (Step 8) to refine
- Send specific feedback to appropriate agent
