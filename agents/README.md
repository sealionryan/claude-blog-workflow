# 📰 Claude-Powered Blog Workflow

Automated, multi-agent system that takes a single keyword and delivers a fully-written, SEO-optimised Markdown article. Built on the [Claude Sub-Agents](https://github.com/webdevtoday/claude-agents) framework.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Kick off the end-to-end workflow (recommended)
> /blog-orchestrate

# Provide the brief when prompted:
#   – search_term  (keyword or working title)
#   – context      (background, tone, audience)
#   – keywords     (optional CSV of target SEO terms)
#   – allow_web    (true to let the Brainstormer sample SERPs)
```
The master *Blog Workflow Orchestrator* will coordinate all sub-agents and return a finished article plus metadata files.

### Two-Phase Option  
Prefer human control over H2 selection?  
Run `/blog-orchestrate`, review the brainstormed headings, reply with a `# keep / # drop` list, then call:
```bash
/blog-continue --selection "<your selection block>"
```

## 🧩 Agent Roster
| Role | Command | Key Task |
|------|---------|---------||
| **Orchestrator** | `/blog-orchestrate` | Oversees complete workflow |
| Brainstormer | `/blog-brainstorm` | Generate intro ideas, 20 H2s, conclusion ideas |
| Outline Writer | `/blog-outline` | Select 5-10 H2s & finalise H3 hierarchy |

## ✨ Highlights
* **Master-Sub-Agent Architecture** – clear separation of duties with quality gates at every phase.
* **Flexible H3 Logic** – each H2 gets 0–5 H3s *only if needed* to avoid bloated outlines.
* **Human-in-the-Loop** – optional selection step lets editors choose which H2s make the final cut.
* **Extensible** – add new agents (e.g., Image Generator, SEO Auditor) by dropping prompt files into `.claude/agents/`.
